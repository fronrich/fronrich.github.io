              My name is Fronrich Puno. I am a second-year student at The University
              of Texas at Austin working on a Bachelors of Science and Art in
              Computer Science and Philosophy of Law. I am well versed in Java,
              HTML5, HTML, and CSS. I am proficient in C++ and Lua and am in the
              process of learning Javascript and Python. I have studied the works
              of philosophers such as Socrates, Anselm, Hume, Kant, and Hitchens to
              name a few.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond my academia, I am a cellist of eight years, a
              musical producer, and a poet. I am a self-taught graphic design
              artist with specialization in vector graphics and image
              manipulation. I rock climb and even had the opportunity to help
              mentor a climbing class this past summer at St. Mary’s University.
              Tatsuya Ramen on South Lamar is my go-to for post-midterm dinners,
              but I have a pretty open pallet and love trying new food.

            <p>
              I believe that regardless of whether we are the product of a conscious
              endeavor by a higher power or the result of a chain of incidental
              processes, we are ultimately the means by which the universe is able
              to admire itself. Because of this, I believe that a fulfilled
              existence involves finding ways to love your life, helping others
              learn to love their own lives, and improving the quality of life for
              all things living. I strive to use technology as a means to these
              ends.
